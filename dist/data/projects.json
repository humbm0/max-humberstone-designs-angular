            "content":"As the distribution and accessibility of music has become easier, users have become overloaded with content and struggle to find music they like for different situations. Users reporting a bias towards chart music and finding new music can be difficult. To try and solve the problem of content overload services have implemented personal/suggested playlists to match songs to the users preferences. However the logic used to match these songs is very basic - selecting songs by the same artist, same genre, or songs other users have bought. Users reported that “I would never listen to something like that!”. "
