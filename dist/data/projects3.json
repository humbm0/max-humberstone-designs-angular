It is estimated that up to 10% of adults of at least 40 years of age worldwide suffer from COPD. One of the biggest issue with ambulatory oxygen therapy is misuse, with many patients under or over using their oxygen. This is because users rely on personal feeling to judge whether or not oxygen is needed. Interviews with oxygen therapy patients also uncovered the problems with existing products on the market as well as pain points of living with supplement oxygen."
